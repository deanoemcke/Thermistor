#Thermistor Examples
Two example uses for the thermistor class are included:
 
* Simple Thermistor Example: shows how to connect and read a thermistor at a set interval, posting the values to Xively to produce a graph.
* Battery Thermistor Example: shows how to produce the same results as the simple example, but while running on a battery. This example includes a few hardware changes to use energy more conscientiously.
